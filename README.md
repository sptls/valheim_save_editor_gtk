# Valheim Save Editor GTK

![alt text](ss.png)

Valheim character editor made for Linux using gtkmm.
At this time it has only basic functionality like changing name, appeareance, gender, Guardian Power and cooldown. I'll add more features when I will have time...
Might break your save, use at own risk.
